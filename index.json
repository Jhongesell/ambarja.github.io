The Lookout Hills GSDF (8.3 km3) on Bonne Bay (glacial trough) may be the largest GSDF in eastern Canada.  It appears to be a post-glacial feature, has vertical total displacement up to 100 m, and exhibits a complex arrangement of scarps and fissures.  Four other large GSDFs occur along the walls of glacial troughs in the Tablelands of Western Newfoundland with estimated volumes between 1 to 2 km3. All five features are above steep slopes and have the potential to become catastrophic massive rock slope failures. While it is tempting to link the failure in all 5 GSDFs to the removal of laterally supporting bedrock or glacier ice during the late Pleistocene, the location of these deformations may simply relate to slope steepness. Non-glacial, first order controls on the deformation include changes in the effective shear strength and opening of fractures owing to Holocene permafrost thaw may have induced failure. Other climatogenic or even seismogenic triggers are possible.  However, no discernable movement has occurred in the Tablelands GSDFs in the last 50 years and the slowness of motion, combined with the absence of residential or commercial development, limit their significance as a future hazard. Nevertheless, the Lookout Hills GSDF requires more detailed study to determine the potential for future movement as rapid collapse into the adjacent fiord may present significant risk to coastal residents, infrastructure and marine ecosystems. The pattern of increasing frequency and intensity of storms events, increased winter precipitation in some locations, and more erratic temperature changes during late winter and spring, may result in an increase in movement aided by freeze-thaw.  These five sites collectively represent an opportunity to better understand large GSDFs from both a process and risk perspective.","tags":[],"title":"Examples of large-scale rock slope deformation from the Tablelands and Lookout Hills of Western Newfoundland, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Dewey maintains several R packages (ggspatial, exifr, and rclimateca) and two Android applications on Google Play (Canada Weather and Prairie Coordinates).

As the 'tailpipe of North America', many Maritime Canadian lakes were acidified as a result of atmospheric transport of U.S. emissions, a process which potentially introduced trace metals to these systems. Maritime Canada has experienced significant historic land disturbance through forestry, water-level change, and urbanization, and is thus an ideal place to investigate the relationship between long-term trace metal accumulation and catchment land-use change. Using ^210^Pb-dated gravity cores from 22 Maritime-Canadian lakes with varied land-use histories, we reconstructed trace metal accumulation and watershed disturbance at decadal resolution over the past ~200 years. Preliminary results from the greater Halifax region suggest that Fe, Mn, and As are particularly sensitive to oxygen conditions at the sediment-water interface, and that increased Cu was associated with the onset of urbanization in some urbanized watersheds. The mean timing of increased Pb deposition occurred at AD 1921±42 in the Halifax region and was consistent with atmospheric deposition from the use of leaded gasoline, however only in some lakes have Pb concentrations decreased since the phasing out of lead in gasoline. Collectively, our data suggest that that that historic sources of trace metals to Maritime Canadian catchments are still contributing to the contemporary trace metal load in lake sediments, and must be considered in the management of these systems.","tags":[],"title":"Land-use controls on spatiotemporal trace metal accumulation in Maritime Canadian lakes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","Ian S.

Advances in X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology has led to the availability of high-resolution, high-quality bulk geochemical data for aquatic sediments, which in combination with carbon, nitrogen, δ13C, and δ15N have the potential to identify watershed-scale disturbance in lake sediment cores. We integrated documented anthropogenic disturbances and changes in bulk geochemical parameters at 8 lakes within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM), Nova Scotia, Canada, 6 of which serve as drinking water sources. These data reflect more than 2 centuries of anthropogenic disturbance in the HRM that included deforestation, urbanization and related development, and water-level change. Deforestation activity was documented at Lake Major and Pockwock Lake by large increases in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (50–300%), and moderate increases in C/N (10%). Urbanization was resolved at Lake Fletcher, Lake Lemont, and First Lake by increases in Ti, Zr, K, and Rb (10–300%), decreases in C/N (10%), and increases in δ15N (2.0‰). These data broadly agree with previous paleolimnological bioproxy data, in some cases identifying disturbances that were not previously identified. Collectively these data suggest that bulk geochemical parameters and lake sediment archives are a useful method for lake managers to identify causal mechanisms for possible water quality changes resulting from watershed-scale disturbance.","tags":[],"title":"Anthropogenic activity in the Halifax region, Nova Scotia, Canada, as recorded by bulk geochemistry of lake sediments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","Ian S.

Water utilities build infrastructure for multi-decadal life cycles, where there is seldom a multi-decadal water quality record from which to assess long-term variability. Lake sediment has long been used to assess long-term variability in surface water quality, and has been used to obtain information about inter-annual to centennial scale changes that predate the monitoring record in drinking water reservoirs. Using 10 sediment cores collected from 6 water supply reservoirs near Halifax, Nova Scotia, we demonstrate the utility of a lake sediment approach to long-term water quality variability in the context of water supply management. The methodology used was designed to be a cost-effective, accessible, and applied approach to well-established limnological methods. Our results indicate that these methods were able to (1) assess the magnitude of past water quality variability in all reservoirs, (2) suggest additional water quality parameters that should be measured based on sedimentary metal concentrations, and (3) suggest probable future trends in dissolved organic carbon based on stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen.

These data and data collected in the future are most useful when compared with each other and analyzed together, which is often inhibited by inconsistent data formats and a lack of structured documentation provided by researchers and (or) data repositories. In this paper we describe a linked table-based structure that encodes multiparameter spatiotemporal data and their documentation that is both flexible (able to store a wide variety of data sets) and usable (can easily be viewed, edited, and converted to plottable formats). The format is a collection of five tables (Data, Locations, Params, Data Sets, and Columns), on which restrictions are placed to ensure data are represented consistently from multiple sources. These tables can be stored in a variety of ways including spreadsheet files, comma-separated value (CSV) files, JavaScript object notation (JSON) files, databases, or objects in a software environment such as R or Python. A toolkit for users of R statistical software was also developed to facilitate converting data to and from the data format. We have used this format to combine data from multiple sources with minimal metadata loss and to effectively archive and communicate the results of spatiotemporal studies. We believe that this format and associated discussion of data and data storage will facilitate increased synergies between past, present, and future data sets in the environmental science community.","tags":[],"title":"Using a linked table-based structure to encode self-describing multiparameter spatiotemporal data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","I.

In Atlantic Canada, historical logging and watershed development for hydroelectric power generation have significantly altered flow dynamics and seasonal discharge in forested upland river systems and yet the ecological impact and environmental legacy of these practices is not well understood. In this study, the bulk geochemistry of a 14C and 210Pb-dated sediment core from a fluvial lake on the West Branch of the Avon River, Nova Scotia, Canada was used to elucidate the environmental impact of these practices.\nSub-bottom sonar was used to located a deep-water coring site where current was minimal and sediment accumulation had occurred. Three environmental periods were recognized in the sedimentary archive. The pre-disturbance (pre-1890 AD) period was characterized by coarse sediment, low carbon concentrations and relatively high metal loads. Increasing strontium may be associated with substantial anadromous fish residency. Significant environmental impact is evident in the last 150 years. Logging and hydraulic disruption during the second period (~ 1890 – 1910 AD) resulted in multiple unconformities and fluctuations in watershed stability proxies (particle size, Ti, K, total C/N, 13C, 15N) that collectively indicate significant forest floor, bankside and basin erosion. Hydroelectric damming, a reduction in watershed area, and a reduction in discharge during the third period (~1920 to Present) has resulted in a decrease in particle size and an increase in algal matter. Fluvial erosion decreased during this period along with concentrations of most metals. Modern logging techniques in the watershed over the past 40 years appear to have had little impact on sediment bulk geochemistry. Low strontium in this interval may indicate a reduction in anadromous fish in the river system coinciding with the installation of dams and the construction in 1970 of flood control gates downstream from the site. Collectively these data indicate that fluvial lakes can contain robust records that can be used to provide guidance for watershed scale assessment of environmental impact.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of historical logging and hydroelectric development on an upland river system, nova scotia, canada: a paleolimnological perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ian Spooner","Sarah Principato","Nicholas Hill","Hilary White","Dewey Dunnington","Tom Neily","Susann Stolze"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504915200,"objectID":"a6e10816f0538a8673bc109650e6aefd","permalink":"/publication/spooner_etal17/","publishdate":"2017-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/spooner_etal17/","section":"publication","summary":"An understanding of the morphological stability and succession of open water and wetland ecosystems in Nova Scotia is a priority for informing the conservation management of critical habitats for a complex of nationally listed, rare, disjunct wetland species. Baltzer Bog and Big Meadow Bog in southwestern Nova Scotia contain stratigraphic records of late Holocene moisture variability. Baltzer Bog is a shrub bog that formed in an elevated, enclosed kettle basin. Excavated sections exposed by peat mining revealed 2 distinct wood-rich horizons that are located above a well-developed soil and wood horizon that yielded a radiocarbon-dated age of 3260 cal. BP from an upright stump. The overlying wood-rich horizons were dated at 1640 and 1045 cal. BP and were overlain by Sphagnum species transitions indicative of increasing wetness. At Big Meadow Bog, a thin wood mat in Sphagnum at 90 cm depth was dated at 1760 cal. BP. These records are broadly correlative with pollen and stratigraphic data from Pleasant River Fen in central Nova Scotia that indicate periods of high and low productivity and a fluctuating water table from 1950 cal. BP until present. Though other high-resolution paleoclimate records from the region indicate that the late Holocene was a time of increasing precipitation and cooler air temperatures, these wetland records demonstrate that in Nova Scotia this time period was characterized by rapid variations in effective moisture and that significant and sustained dry periods likely occurred.

Water utilities build infrastructure for multi-decadal life cycles, where there is seldom a multi-decadal water quality record from which to assess long-term variability. Lake sediment has long been used to assess long-term variability in surface water quality, and has been used to obtain information about inter-annual to centennial scale changes that predate the monitoring record in drinking water reservoirs. Using 10 sediment cores collected from 6 water supply reservoirs near Halifax, Nova Scotia, we demonstrate the utility of a lake sediment approach to long-term water quality variability in the context of water supply management. The methodology used was designed to be a cost-effective, accessible, and applied approach to well-established limnological methods. Our results indicate that these methods were able to (1) assess the magnitude of past water quality variability in all reservoirs, (2) suggest additional water quality parameters that should be measured based on sedimentary metal concentrations, and (3) suggest probable future trends in dissolved organic carbon based on stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Collectively our data suggest a set of limnological techniques, sediment analyses, and data management strategies that together form a preliminary framework with which to apply lake sediment analysis to the assessment of drinking water reservoirs.","tags":[],"title":"Using Lake Sediment to predict future treatment challenges: A case study from Halifax, Nova Scotia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","Hilary White","Ian S.

Aquatic sediment concentrations of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr) in Long Lake fluctuated substantially and, during some periods, exceeded guidelines for the protection of aquatic life. Increases in lead (Pb), Hg, Cr, trace metals, and nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) were broadly coincident with a period of widespread drying from ca. 8000 to 4000 cal BP and were likely a consequence of regional fires. From ca. 4000 cal BP until 1700 AD, metal levels in general were low due to decreased erosion, increased precipitation, and reduced fire activity. Water level lowering and forced sediment aggradation (tiding) in the 1800s led to increases in minerogenic Pb and Cr, though fossil fuel combustion also likely contributed to total Pb concentrations. Stratigraphic proxies indicated increased inorganic sedimentation rates, and reduced autochthonous productivity were coincident with lower Hg and As concentrations in the Long Lake sediment. Our data indicate that natural phenomena (fire) can result in sediment contaminant exceedances, that most metals have multiple sources, and that both human-induced disturbance and emissions have contributed to Pb contamination in the last 200 years. In addition, wetter and generally cooler climate appeared to favour lower concentrations of contaminants in lake sediments. Although wetland sediments in the Cumberland Basin Marshes are not heavily polluted with metals, the development of constructed wetlands and the disruption of aquatic sediments have the potential to concentrate, mobilize, and increase the bioavailability of metals.","tags":[],"title":"A paleolimnological archive of metal sequestration and release in the Cumberland Basin Marshes, Atlantic Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","I.

In particular, read.csv() produces ugly results, and using Excel to remove extraneous information is both time-consuming and results in significant data loss (since an Excel user is unlikely to keep other tables that may exist other than the data itself). So instead, with an eye towards including a driver for this data type in the rclimateca package, I decided to look into line-by-line parsing in R.\nReading files line-by-line in R While other languages (Python in particular) make it easy to iterate through files by line, this strategy has never been popular in R. There is, in large part, no need to read a file line-by-line, in large part due to the excellent read.csv() and read.delim() functions (plus the readr package for even more). An exception to this is data distributed in non-standard formats, such as CSVs with lots of header information. The NatChem format probably contains the most header information that I have ever seen in a CSV (even compared with Environment Canada\u0026rsquo;s historical climate data distribution format, which has a large number of extraneous rows containing location, parameter, and flag information), which means to automatically parse these files we need the line-by-line strategy.\nFor small files, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to use readLines() with the filename as the first argument, then iterate through each line using a for loop (readLines() returns a character vector with one element per line). This strategy gets more difficult when the files get large, and is especially inefficient if most of the information in the file will be disregarded anyway. Still, it\u0026rsquo;s incredibly easy, and worth demonstrating.\nlines \u0026lt;- readLines(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) head(lines)  ## [1] \u0026quot;*DATA EXCHANGE STANDARD VERSION,NATCHEM PRECIP 2003/01/17 (1.01),,,,,,,,,\u0026quot; ## [2] \u0026quot;*COMMENT,For information on this file please see the NAtChem web site http://www.ec.gc.ca/natchem/\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;*COMMENT,Network descriptions and links to home pages are provided on the NAtChem web site.\u0026quot; ## [4] \u0026quot;*COMMENT,Data Originators or NAtChem Staff may occasionally revise data files.

Most objects in R are copied whenever they are modified, or more specifically, calling a function with an object as an argument almost never results in that object being modified in the calling environment. This is fairly useful in most cases, but reading a file is not one of those cases. Enter one of the few natively mutable objects in R: the \u0026ldquo;file connection\u0026rdquo;.\nconnection \u0026lt;- file(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) open(connection) for(i in 1:6) { print(readLines(connection, n=1)) }  ## [1] \u0026quot;*DATA EXCHANGE STANDARD VERSION,NATCHEM PRECIP 2003/01/17 (1.01),,,,,,,,,\u0026quot; ## [1] \u0026quot;*COMMENT,For information on this file please see the NAtChem web site http://www.ec.gc.ca/natchem/\u0026quot; ## [1] \u0026quot;*COMMENT,Network descriptions and links to home pages are provided on the NAtChem web site.\u0026quot; ## [1] \u0026quot;*COMMENT,Data Originators or NAtChem Staff may occasionally revise data files.

Always close() the connection when you are finished! If you don\u0026rsquo;t, R will yell at you at some point telling you that you never closed the connection. Notice that the connection object is modified when passed to open(), readLines() and close(), whereas in \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; R code you would have to do something like connection \u0026lt;- open(connection) to acheive a similar result. Language details aside, this approach avoids the possible danger of loading a huge file into memory by accident (although if the file does not have any line endings, this is still a problem).\nSo far the above strategy works if we know we have to read a fixed number of lines, but in most cases the number of lines in the file is unknown. After some experimentation, it seems that readLines() will return character(0) when there are no more lines in the file (not to be confused with an empty string \u0026quot;\u0026quot;, which is an empty line). We can use this in conjunction with a while loop to loop through every line in the file.\nconnection \u0026lt;- file(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) open(connection) line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) while(length(line) \u0026gt; 0) { # do something with each line # ... # read a new line line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) } close(connection)  Processing the lines So far we can iterate through lines, but what\u0026rsquo;s the point? In this case, we need to exctract specific information about the contents of the files. To this end, there are two (among others) useful functions: scan() and grepl(). The scan() function was built to parse delimited text, which covers most of the things that are read in a line-by-line strategy (such as NatChem).\nconnection \u0026lt;- file(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) open(connection) first_line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) line1_elements \u0026lt;- scan(text=first_line, what = character(1), sep=\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;) close(connection) line1_elements  ## [1] \u0026quot;*DATA EXCHANGE STANDARD VERSION\u0026quot; \u0026quot;NATCHEM PRECIP 2003/01/17 (1.01)\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [11] \u0026quot;\u0026quot;  There are a number of arguments to scan() that control what it\u0026rsquo;s looking for and how it will find it, although the only ones I\u0026rsquo;ve personally used are quiet=TRUE (which suppresses the message that reports how many items have been read) and strip.white=TRUE (which strips whitespace). Many of these are also options in read.csv(), although if you\u0026rsquo;re making use of them it\u0026rsquo;s a good sign that you should probably be using read.csv() or something similar to read your data.\nThe second thing that is useful is searching for specific text in a line (for example, a line that may suggest that table information exists in a specific loction). In the NatChem format, there are lines that read *TABLE BEGINS and *TABLE ENDS at the beginning and end of table data, respectively. Thus, we can use grepl() to search for lines that contain these strings to delineate where tables begin and end.\nconnection \u0026lt;- file(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) table_start \u0026lt;- integer(0) table_end \u0026lt;- integer(0) open(connection) line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) line_number \u0026lt;- 1L while(length(line) \u0026gt; 0) { # check for table begin/end if(grepl(\u0026quot;*TABLE BEGINS\u0026quot;, line, fixed = TRUE)) { table_start \u0026lt;- c(table_start, line_number) } else if(grepl(\u0026quot;*TABLE ENDS\u0026quot;, line, fixed = TRUE)) { table_end \u0026lt;- c(table_end, line_number) } # read a new line (and increment line number) line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) line_number \u0026lt;- line_number + 1 } close(connection) rbind(table_start, table_end)  ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## table_start 35 60 75 98 120 ## table_end 51 65 85 101 189  It\u0026rsquo;s worth noting that grepl() takes its arguments in reversed order to what you would expect based on other vectorized R functions (that is, grepl(\u0026quot;what you're looking for\u0026quot;, where_to_look)). By default, the search term in grepl() is a regular expression, which you can disable by using fixed=TRUE. Unless you actually want to use a regular expression, it\u0026rsquo;s best to use fixed=TRUE since many common characters are reserved in regular expressions and may produce unexpected results. For a more consistent implementation of regular expression matching, see the stringr package.\nExtracting the tables Just extracting the start and end lines of the tables isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly useful without the table name/column information data, which is also provided in NatChem files. These lines look like *TABLE NAME,... and *TABLE COLUMN NAME,...,...,..., respectively. Using these data, we can read a full specification of each table into a list.\nconnection \u0026lt;- file(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) # these will be updated as the file is read table_start \u0026lt;- NA table_end \u0026lt;- NA table_name \u0026lt;- NA table_columns \u0026lt;- NA # this will contain the output tables \u0026lt;- list() open(connection) line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) line_number \u0026lt;- 1L while(length(line) \u0026gt; 0) { # check for table begin/end if(grepl(\u0026quot;*TABLE BEGINS\u0026quot;, line, fixed = TRUE)) { # update the table start line number table_start \u0026lt;- line_number } else if(grepl(\u0026quot;*TABLE ENDS\u0026quot;, line, fixed = TRUE)) { # update the table end line number table_end \u0026lt;- line_number # on table end, update 'tables' with a full specification tables[[length(tables)+1]] \u0026lt;- list(name=table_name, columns=table_columns, start=table_start, end=table_end) } else if(grepl(\u0026quot;*TABLE NAME,\u0026quot;, line, fixed = TRUE)) { # update the table name line_fields \u0026lt;- scan(text=line, sep=\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, what = character(1), quiet = TRUE) table_name \u0026lt;- line_fields[2] } else if(grepl(\u0026quot;*TABLE COLUMN NAME,\u0026quot;, line, fixed = TRUE)) { # update the column names line_fields \u0026lt;- scan(text=line, sep=\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;, what = character(1), quiet = TRUE) table_columns \u0026lt;- line_fields[2:length(line_fields)] } # read a new line (and increment line number) line \u0026lt;- readLines(connection, n=1) line_number \u0026lt;- line_number + 1 } close(connection) tables[1]  ## [[1]] ## [[1]]$name ## [1] \u0026quot;Network comments: office\u0026quot; ## ## [[1]]$columns ## [1] \u0026quot;Comment codes: office\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Description\u0026quot; ## [3] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [5] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [7] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## [9] \u0026quot;\u0026quot; \u0026quot;\u0026quot; ## ## [[1]]$start ## [1] 35 ## ## [[1]]$end ## [1] 51  Of course, there\u0026rsquo;s still much room for improvement, but that\u0026rsquo;s the gist of it. Overall, reading files line-by-line isn\u0026rsquo;t usually what you want, but in my case of reading hundreds of NatChem files at a time, it is the most robust solution in a language that wasn\u0026rsquo;t really built to handle it. The syntax needed to update variables without a fixed length is lacking in R, which makes writing code like the above awkward (in general it is terrible practice to use c() to update a vector, but if the output isn\u0026rsquo;t of known length, there aren\u0026rsquo;t any easy alternatives).\nVectorized Solutions There are some vectorized solutions to the above examples, that may be appropriate if the parsing is simple. For example, reading the line numbers of *BEGIN TABLE and *END TABLE is easy to do using readLines() and grep() (which is essentially which(grepl(...))).\nlines \u0026lt;- readLines(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;) rbind(grep(\u0026quot;*TABLE BEGINS\u0026quot;, lines, fixed = TRUE), grep(\u0026quot;*TABLE ENDS\u0026quot;, lines, fixed = TRUE))  ## [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] ## [1,] 35 60 75 98 120 ## [2,] 51 65 85 101 189  Extracting more information gets more complicated, especially if some information is omitted. The above example breaks down very quickly if anything is malformed about the file, since the parsing will fail with an unhelpful error message if for some reason there is no *TABLE ENDS after table data.\nPerformance Normally looping in R is thought of as slow, but in this case, it\u0026rsquo;s not as slow as you might expect. If we use vapply() to create a stripped-down version of the native readLines() and benchmark, it looks like the native readLines() is a little faster, but not enough to be noticable unless the files start to get huge (in which case a line-by-line strategy may end up faster due to reduced memory allocation). With variable-length output (i.e. using c() to create variable length output vectors), it\u0026rsquo;s likely that looping will get progressively slower with longer files. Still, if there are only a few lines that need extracting, it may be worth it.\nreadLines_R \u0026lt;- function(csvfile, n=6) { connection \u0026lt;- file(csvfile) open(connection) lines \u0026lt;- vapply(1:n, function(i) readLines(connection, n=1), character(1)) close(connection) return(lines) } library(microbenchmark) microbenchmark(readLines(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;, n=6), readLines_R(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;, n=6))  ## Unit: microseconds ## expr min lq mean ## readLines(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;, n = 6) 85.383 86.772 90.44636 ## readLines_R(\u0026quot;natchem_sample.CSV\u0026quot;, n = 6) 113.100 115.400 120.09061 ## median uq max neval ## 87.6335 89.716 180.586 100 ## 116.5595 121.016 162.676 100  Parsing NatChem The full parsing of the NatChem format will be available soon though the rclimateca package, along with (hopefully) an extractor for HYDAT hydrological data (which is, as you may have guessed, in a completely different format).\n","date":1490572800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490627988,"objectID":"4c8aa4b2d50bb72810b5f5bc565b9f51","permalink":"/post/2017/line-by-line-row-by-row.../","publishdate":"2017-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2017/line-by-line-row-by-row.../","section":"post","summary":"The NatChem database from Environment Canada contains the best long-term atmospheric monitoring data that exists for Canada, similar to the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) in the US.

Channel avulsion at AD 1754 ± 81 on the 21-Mile Creek alluvial fan resulted in increased deposition of organic matter with a signal of autochthonous production. A decrease in δ13C beginning at AD 1949 ± 17 indicates an increase in pelagic productivity relative to benthic productivity and/or sewage input to Alta Lake. A corresponding increase in δ15N indicates an increase in sewage-derived nutrients during the same time period. These changes were synchronous and coincide with the onset of rapid development in the Whistler Valley. Increased metal deposition (Cu, As, and Zn) during the same period resulted from watershed disturbance during highway construction. Cu, As, and Zn concentrations correlated positively with C concentrations and negatively with Ti and K, suggesting removal of metals from the water column is closely related to autochthonous organic matter deposition. Fe/Mn ratios and Mo concentrations were expected to respond to hypolimnetic oxygen availability in response to decreased flushing rate and increased productivity following the loss of inflow from 21-Mile Creek, but did not display a clear time-stratigraphic signal.

Dedicated programs have attempted to ameliorate these problems, but the storage format used can be inflexible and/or proprietary, limiting the exchange of data and replicability of visualizations and statistical analyses. This poster conceptualizes values as having qualifiers (e.g. core identifier, depth below surface, and measured parameter) and tags (e.g. amount of error, number of replicates, written notes pertaining to the value), each of which are represented differently depending on the data structure used. This poster identifies four data structures among many as optimal for storing paleolimnological data: a raw values list, a summarized values list, a raw values matrix, and a summarized values matrix. The former two are long-format structures that store each qualifier category as a column (e.g. core identifier, depth, and parameter) with one row per measured value. The two later structures are wide-format structures that store the values for each measured parameter in separate columns. Summarized variants store one value per unique depth, whereas raw variants are able to store values for each replicate. Long data structures store tags more easily than wide data structures, however wide data structures are used more often as input for plotting routines and statistical analyses optimized for paleolimnological data. The conversion between these four structures is easily accomplished using both interactive (e.g. spreadsheet software) and programmatic (e.g. R and Python) mechanisms. As more advanced statistical treatment of data becomes common in paleolimnological studies, storing data in its most flexible form may be advantageous to enhance the replicability of visualizations and statistical analysis. Readily available conversion mechanisms ensure storing data in its raw form is not a barrier to fast and effective completion of this process.","tags":[],"title":"Flexible, platform-independent, open-source data structures and conversion mechanisms for paleolimnological data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","I.

As the cost of treatment is directly impacted by changes in metal concentrations, dissolved organic carbon, and other water quality parameters, watershed managers have a vested interested in obtaining information about inter-annual to centennial scale changes that predate the monitoring record for each reservoir. From a scientific perspective, the availability of long-term monitoring data for drinking water reservoirs is conducive to informing interpretation of bulk geochemical proxies from these lakes. In partnership with Halifax Water, 6 sediment cores were taken from 3 surface water reservoirs within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Preliminary data from lakebed sediment cores at Pockwock Lake and Lake Major suggest that changes in water quality occurred in response to early logging and lake level rise following the construction of a dam in each lake. The magnitude and nature of further water quality changes will be further constrained by pending C/N stable isotope data and ^210^Pb chronology. The geochemical assessment of sediment from drinking water reservoirs is a synergistic partnership between paleolimnologists and watershed managers that will continue to be explored as the project continues.","tags":[],"title":"Preliminary results and experimental design for a bulk geochemical assessment of sediment from drinking water reservoirs in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca","I.

The paleolimnological approach can be used to reconstruct variability of water quality parameters over longer time scales in contrast to the limited range of limnological studies, providing the necessary context in which to decouple natural and anthropogenic change in lacustrine systems. Alta Lake, in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, is a small, recreationally important lake.

Nova Scotia has a 300 year history of watershed alteration and impact. Water quality, habitat stability and bioavailability of metals in lakes are a significant concern and resource managers lack effective water quality risk assessment techniques. We use applied paleolimnological techniques including X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technology to address specific knowledge gaps and decouple the effects of within lake stressors (primarily acidity and anoxia) from watershed scale disturbance. Paleolimnological investigations in the Cumberland Marsh Region (CMR) and Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM) provided insight into the influences of water column chemistry (salinity, pH, Eh, etc.), sediment composition and changing environmental conditions on metal (As, Pb, Fe, Mn) sequestration and mobility in lake sediments. Studies in HRM noted persistent increases in a variety of toxic trace metals that are associated with mining in the 1800s. Remobilization of legacy mining waste remaining in soils was a significant source of recent lakebed sediment contamination. In the CMR, high Pb concentrations in lakebed sediments and gastropods correlated with water column salinity and sulphide content. Lead bioavailability may be most strongly associated with the form of Pb and sediment composition. In all studies we were able to use the paleolimnological method and XRF analyses of lakebed sediments to link changes in abiotic proxies in sediment cores to the known history of the lake basin, leading to a better understanding of how lakes and watersheds react to anthropogenic influence. The outcomes of private sector partnerships have indicated that rapid technology and competency transfer is possible, the approach is cost and time effective and can be integrated into the companies’ service portfolio. Our public partners have used the information to make informed management decisions. These experiences indicate that application of the paleolimnological approach has the potential to provide researchers with access a wide range of projects and funding sources.","tags":[],"title":"Using paleolimnological techniques and XRF to investigate metal sequestration, mobility, and bioavailability in shallow lakes: case studies from Nova Scotia, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1446336000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1446336000,"objectID":"84e883514438a92a8e734dbfe2044b78","permalink":"/publication/dunnington15/","publishdate":"2015-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dunnington15/","section":"publication","summary":"Small, recreationally important lakes are economically critical to communities across Canada.

The Border Marshes are located along the Atlantic migratory flyway and are particularly important for waterfowl and marshbird production providing both migration and breeding habitat. Though ecosystem integrity has been studied extensively, there are no records of the physical and chemical evolution of lakes in the CBM. In this study we use the paleolimnological method at Long Lake to construct a 10,000 year record of both natural and anthropogenically influenced change.\nThe paleolimnological records were derived from percussion and gravity cores and indicate that Long Lake was a productive, fresh water lake from at least 10,500 cal. BP, long before most lakes in the CBM were established. Increases in various metals including Pb, As and Hg in the core at about  5000 cal. BP are likely the consequence of regional fires, and indicate that a significant reservoir of these metals exists in the natural environment.  The fire events are broadly coincident with a period of widespread drying from 8000 to 4000 cal. BP. Wetter conditions and a raised water table have persisted at the site since 4000 cal. BP.  Though tidal range had increased by this time, δ13C data indicate that long-term marine incursions did not occur at the Long Lake site. The gravity core data indicate that physical and biological character of Long Lake has been fundamentally altered in the last 300 years by anthropogenic activity.  Evidence of water level lowering and forced sediment aggradation (tiding) in the 1800s was found, consistent with historical records.  Increases in metals near the top of the core are likely associated with fossil fuel combustion and naturally occurring lead mobilized by sediment re-suspension and mixing associated with boat traffic. Collectively these data indicate that Long Lake may be one of the oldest lakes in the Cumberland Basin marshes and has been fundamentally altered by anthropogenic activity in the last 300 years. The sediments in Long Lake may also represent a source for the bioaccumulation of specific metals.","tags":[],"title":"A 10 000 year record of environmental change at Long Lake, Cumberland Marshes, Nova Scotia-New Brunswick border region, Canada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ion Ratiu","Antony Marcos Barja Ingaruca"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349049600,"objectID":"db8ddc8fce2534a400eb4d2d67f3b0f2","permalink":"/publication/conf_ratiu_dunnington12/","publishdate":"2012-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conf_ratiu_dunnington12/","section":"publication","summary":"Remediation of salt impacted soils remains a major issue in the environmental industry, as brine constituents from fluid discharges infiltrate soils affecting vegetation growth and water quality.

Evaluation of existing systems suggested that continuous monitoring of leachate quality, automated control and routing of the recovered fluids would further increase the efficiency of remediation process.\nThe remediation technique implemented at the site includes installation of a flow-computer monitored and controlled leachate collection and recovery system enhanced by surface irrigation and subsurface injection.  Installation of continuous monitoring and automated control within the leachate recovery portion of the in-situ remediation system provides data recording, communications support, electrical conductivity (EC) monitoring, and valve control.  A flow-computer directs recovered fluid with low EC values toward a series of surface irrigation and subsurface injection systems, or concentrated brine with high EC values toward a series of storage tanks for subsequent deep-well injection.  Additional wells and routing options provide further controls on the remediation program.

Deposition resumed with predominantly inorganic sediment, indicating a fundamental change in depositional dynamics. Geochemcial proxy data suggest sediment resuspension and mixing have occurred in the top few centimetres of sediment, possibly due to increased turbulence from motorboat activity.
